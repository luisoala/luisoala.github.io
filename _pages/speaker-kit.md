Luis works on composable systems for measuring, optimizing and exchanging data states across the entire data generating process in machine learning. In regular intervals, he shares his ideas through computer code and longer texts spanning topics such as data optimization [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC)], ML data formats [[1](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC), [3](https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html)] or measurement tools for ML systems [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C)]. He also enjoys promoting opportunities for community. He helped initiate machine learning venues such as [Data-Centric Machine Learning Research (DMLR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13028) and [AI for Good](https://aiforgood.itu.int/eventcat/discovery-data-centric-machine-learning-for-good/) and co-chaired conferences such as [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/Committees), the [DMLR workshop](https://dmlr.ai/) series or [ML4H](https://ml4h.cc/2023/). He is Head of Machine Learning at Swiss company [Dotphoton](https://www.dotphoton.com/) and a PhD research scientist at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai.html) of [Wojciech Samek](http://iphome.hhi.de/samek/) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Berlin, Germany.
