At the moment, Luis typically spends the day contemplating composable systems for measuring, optimizing and exchanging data states across the entire data generating process in machine learning.

In order to avoid becoming an inscrutable hermit, he tries in regular intervals to write these thoughts down in computer code and longer texts spanning topics such as data optimization [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC)], ML data formats [[1](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC), [3](https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html)] or measurement tools for ML systems [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C)].

He also promotes opportunities for community. He helped initiate machine learning venues such as [Data-Centric Machine Learning Research (DMLR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13028) and [AI for Good](https://aiforgood.itu.int/eventcat/discovery-data-centric-machine-learning-for-good/) and co-chaired conferences such as [ML4H](https://ml4h.cc/2023/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/Committees) or the [DMLR workshop](https://dmlr.ai/) series.

He is Head of Machine Learning at Swiss company [Dotphoton](https://www.dotphoton.com/).
