Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Luis Oala. I am Head of Machine Learning at  [Dotphoton](a href="https://dotphoton.com") a PhD research scientist at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai.html) of [Wojciech Samek](http://iphome.hhi.de/samek/) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Berlin, Germany.

Together with my students and collaborators, I work at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, robustness and interpretability to understand and detect failure modes of deep neural networks.

<!--
I am interested in composable systems approaches
Our mission is to develop methods, standards and software for AI auditing that will eventually allow the reliable application of AI technology even in high-stakes applications such as medicine.

For that purpose, I co-chair a group of more than 30 contributors from across the world working on data and AI solution assessment methods at the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H)](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx) and co-organize a growing, open research network at [aiaudit.org](https://aiaudit.org).


If you are interested to collaborate I invite you to take a look [here](https://aiaudit.org/).
