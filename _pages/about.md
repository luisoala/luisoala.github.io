Hi I am Luis. I am interested in composable systems for measuring, optimizing and exchanging data states across the entire data generating process in machine learning.

In regular intervals, I share my ideas through writing, code and presentations spanning topics such as data optimization [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC)], ML data formats [[1](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC), [3](https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html)] or measurement tools for ML systems [[1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC), [3](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC), [4](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), [5](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=v3ybnf0AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=v3ybnf0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C)].

I also enjoy promoting opportunities for community. I helped initiate machine learning venues such as [Data-Centric Machine Learning Research (DMLR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13028) and [AI for Good](https://aiforgood.itu.int/eventcat/discovery-data-centric-machine-learning-for-good/) and co-chaired conferences such as [ML4H](https://ml4h.cc/2023/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/Committees) or the [DMLR workshop](https://dmlr.ai/) series.

I am Head of Machine Learning at Swiss company [Dotphoton](https://www.dotphoton.com/) and a PhD research scientist at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai.html) of [Wojciech Samek](http://iphome.hhi.de/samek/) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Berlin, Germany.

Together with my students and collaborators, I work at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, robustness and interpretability to understand and detect failure modes of deep neural networks.


I am interested in composable systems approaches
Our mission is to develop methods, standards and software for AI auditing that will eventually allow the reliable application of AI technology even in high-stakes applications such as medicine.

For that purpose, I co-chair a group of more than 30 contributors from across the world working on data and AI solution assessment methods at the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H)](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx) and co-organize a growing, open research network at [aiaudit.org](https://aiaudit.org).


If you are interested to collaborate I invite you to take a look [here](https://aiaudit.org/).
