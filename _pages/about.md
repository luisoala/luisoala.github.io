Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Luis Oala. I am a PhD research scientist at the [AI Department](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai.html) of [Wojciech Samek](http://iphome.hhi.de/samek/) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Berlin, Germany.

Together with my students and collaborators, I work at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, robustness and interpretability to understand and detect failure modes of deep neural networks.

Our mission is to develop methods, standards and software for AI auditing that will eventually allow the reliable application of AI technology even in high-stakes applications such as medicine.

For that purpose, I co-chair a group of more than 30 contributors from across the world working on data and AI solution assessment methods at the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H)](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx) and co-organize a growing, open research network at [aiaudit.org](https://aiaudit.org).

If you are interested to collaborate I invite you to take a look [here]().
